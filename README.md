# Data-analysis-for-single-molecule-reactions

Data analysis for single-molecule reactions, including the current levels and reaction sequences

These codes were wrote by Fanyang Mo and Jinglong Lin, organised by Lei Zhang.

Precise electrical gating of the single-molecule Mizoroki-Heck reaction. Nat. Comm. 2022" if you use this software!

System requirements:
Python3 (3.8.5 was tested)
PyCharm Community Edition (2020.2.3 x64 was tested)

Installation guide:
Install Python3 and PyCharm Community Edition according to online available guidance.

Demo:
A small dataset named "PhBr.tex" was provided, and the expected outputs were provided in Supplementary Information (Precise electrical gating of the single-molecule Mizoroki-Heck reaction. Nat. Comm. 2022).

Instructions for use:
##The number and values of the current levels
To determine the number and values of the current levels via input of raw data.
##Programs for data analysis
To idealise the current levels and count certain current level sequences via adopting proper current signal ranges.

Note:
In few cases, the results have a small bias compared original data, and the analysis will base on original data after comparing.
